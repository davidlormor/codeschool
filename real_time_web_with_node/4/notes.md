# Modules

## Require statements
Require statements look for relative and absolute paths
Explicit requires (without path) look for node_modules directories

## NPM
Package manager for node

## Managing packages
Install with npm install for local package
Install with -g tag for global package (must still install locally for each app that uses a package)

## Package.json
Place to specify everything about a project
Specifies dependencies
Run npm install to fix dependencies

## Semantic versioning
X.Y.Z
X = Major version (major breaking API changes)
Y = Minor version (no major breaking API changes)
Z = Patch version (won't break API)

~ to specify a range
